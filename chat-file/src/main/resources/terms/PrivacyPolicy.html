		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Saocoo</strong> collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) and through other interactions and communications you have with us. If you reside in the United States, the Services are provided by <strong>DK Mobility</strong>, LLC and its U.S. affiliates (collectively &ldquo;<strong>Saocoo</strong>&rdquo;), and this Privacy Statement applies to information collected and used by <strong>Saocoo</strong>. If you reside outside of the United States, the Services are provided by <strong>Saocoo</strong>, and this Privacy Statement applies to information collected and used by <strong>Saocoo</strong>.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Scope and Application</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Privacy Statement (&ldquo;Statement") applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to request for household service, delivery, or other on-demand services (&ldquo;Users&rdquo;). This Statement does not apply to information we collect from or about service providers, couriers, partner or any other persons who use the <strong>Saocoo</strong> platform under license (collectively &ldquo;Providers&rdquo;). If you interact with the Services as both a User and a Service Provider, the respective privacy statements apply to your different interactions.</span></p>
		<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Collection of Information</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for household services), delivery notes, and other information you choose to provide.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Location Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you use the Services for lawn care services or household works, we collect precise location data about the service information from the <strong>Saocoo</strong> app used by the Service Providers. If you permit the <strong>Saocoo</strong> app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (&ldquo;platform&rdquo;), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Contacts Information:</strong>&nbsp;If you permit the <strong>Saocoo</strong> app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Transaction Information:</strong>&nbsp;We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Usage and Preference Information:</strong>&nbsp;We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/privacy/cookies"><span class="s2">Cookie Statement</span></a>.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Device Information:</strong>&nbsp;We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and verions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Call and SMS Data</strong>: Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Service Providers. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties&rsquo; phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Log Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Important Information About Platform Permissions</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the <strong>Saocoo</strong> app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the <strong>Saocoo</strong> app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/ios/permissions"><span class="s2">iOS Permissions</span></a>&nbsp;page and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/android/permissions"><span class="s2">Android Permissions</span></a>&nbsp;page. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we&rsquo;ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Information We Collect From Other Sources</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you choose to link, create, or log in to your <strong>Saocoo</strong> account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, such as <strong>Saocoo</strong> for Business, we may receive information about you from your employer.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you request on demand services, our Service Providers may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Service Provider or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a User.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Use of Information</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may use the information we collect about you to:</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including, for example, to facilitate payments, send receipts, provide products and services you request (and send related information), develop new features, provide customer support to Users and Service Providers, develop safety features, authenticate users, and send product updates and administrative messages;</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and abuse of our Services; to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems; to conduct data analysis, testing, and research; and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends;</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Send or facilitate communications (i) between you and a Service Provider, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), or (ii) between you and a contact of yours at your direction in connection with your use of certain features, such as referrals, invites, or ETA sharing;</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Send you communications we think will be of interest to you, including information about products, services, promotions, news, and events of <strong>Saocoo</strong> and other companies, where permissible and according to local applicable laws; and to process contest, sweepstake, or other promotion entries and fulfill any related awards;</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Personalize and improve the Services, including to provide or recommend features, content, social connections, referrals, and advertisements.</span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may transfer the information described in this Statement to, and process and store it in, the United States and other countries, some of which may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Sharing of Information</strong></span></p>
		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may share the information we collect about you as described in this Statement or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:</span></p>

		<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may share your information:</span></p>

Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.</span></p>
		<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</strong></span></p>

If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of our Services.
